# GRID-ASCII-Game-

A free ascii game about dodging bullets that come at you from each side
//sounds easy enough?
but the bullets move only when you move
//wait that's even easier?
and there's no indicator for what direction a bullet is moving
//wait what?

Spend too much time not moving and you'll forget if the bullet in front of you was heading at you or just moving past

A wierd casual strategy game to pass the time
See if you can control the GRID
